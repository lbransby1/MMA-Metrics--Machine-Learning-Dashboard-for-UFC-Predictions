Predict UFC fight outcomes with machine learning! Compare fighters, analyze stats, and see visualized predictions in a sleek interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Compare fighter stats side-by-side
- Predict fight winners using ensemble ML models
- Interactive radar charts & performance tables
- Fighter profiles with images, strengths, and weaknesses
- Swap-averaged predictions to reduce bias

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Streamlit for UI
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost for ML
- Plotly for radar charts
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- BeautifulSoup for fighter images scraping

## ⚡ Quick Start
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lbransby1/ufc-fight-predictor.git
   cd ufc-fight-predictor
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The dashboard should now be live on http://localhost:8501/.

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced

* Handling **messy fight data** (typos, missing values, inconsistent stats)
* Balancing ML models and avoiding **overfitting**
* Getting fighter **images dynamically** from scraping
* Optimizing ensemble voting & swap-averaging for **fairer predictions**
* Deploying a **smooth Streamlit app** with heavy models

---

## 📖 Future Improvements

* Add round-by-round simulation
* Track fighter ELO rankings over time
* Improve data scraping pipeline
* Add betting odds & comparison to model predictions
